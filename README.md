Attendance system using speaker recogniton and speech recognition to avoid proxy 


We used two approaches here - HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL APPROACH AND CNN MODEL APPROACH 


CNN APPROACH
Run the CNN_TRAIN.py file to run training on your datasets. Put in your training samples in the folder called DATASETS, inside which create a folder with each speakers name and put his/her voices in that particular folder

Run CNN_PREDICT.py to accept a new spoken voice which is recorded when you run the code and it then predicts who the speaker is.
